Streetshare is an app we have developed to help people save money and foster community spirit.

How it works:

Free items:

Items are added to the site and are either free or can be borrowed after leaving a deposit with the owner.

For free items the owner there may be may requests for the item and the owner can accept a request and reject the others.

Items available to borrow:

For items that require a deposit, the deposit is paid at the time of reservation.

We have a fully featured messaging system so users can easily communicate with each other.
